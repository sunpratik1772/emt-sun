"""
Typed state carried through a single agent run.

The old `WorkflowCopilot._run_generation` function mutated a dict and a
local list; every new field meant another implicit contract between
caller and callee. This module replaces that with explicit dataclasses
so each step (Planner, AutoFixer, ValidatorAdapter, …) has a clear
input/output signature.

`AgentEvent` is the on-wire shape that eventually becomes an SSE frame
on the copilot endpoint. Keeping it here — next to the state that
generates it — means the harness and the HTTP adapter can't drift
apart.
