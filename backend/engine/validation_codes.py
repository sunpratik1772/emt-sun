"""
Canonical inventory of validator / schema error codes.

Before this module, ~30 error-code string literals were sprinkled
across `validator.py`, `schema_version.py`, `auto_fixer.py`, and any
tests that asserted on codes. Typos failed silently (no import-time
check), the codes had no docstring, and renames required a grep.

`ValidationErrorCode` is a `str`-based enum so:

  * Existing JSON payloads, tests, and contracts don't change — a
    member's value IS the string that used to be hardcoded.
  * `issue.code == "UNKNOWN_TYPE"` still works for legacy callers.
  * Typos become import errors.
  * IDEs autocomplete the full list + docstring on hover.

Keep this sorted alphabetically. When adding a new rule, add the
member here first, then reference it at the call site — that
guarantees the audit trail stays in one place.
