"""
RunContext — the single shared bag every node reads from and writes to.

Mental model: a workflow is a DAG of stateless handler functions. The
only state that flows between them is the RunContext. Each node mutates
the context in place; the dag_runner re-passes the same instance to
every successor.

Three "shelves" by convention — keep them separate so unrelated nodes
don't accidentally collide on a key:

  • alert_payload — the immutable input (trader_id, event_time, …).
  • values        — scalars / config / signals / disposition / etc.
                    Use ctx.set/get; never reach into .values directly
                    from a handler unless you have a reason.
  • datasets      — pandas DataFrames keyed by output_name. The wiring
                    contract is "input_name of node N == output_name of
                    some upstream node." The validator enforces this.
  • sections      — narrative blocks produced by SECTION_SUMMARY for the
                    final report; CONSOLIDATED_SUMMARY consumes them.

Plus a few terminal flags (disposition, output_branch, report_path) the
final REPORT_OUTPUT / decision nodes set so callers (HTTP, tests) can
inspect the outcome without re-walking the graph.

Stays mutable on purpose — turning this immutable would force every
node to copy O(n) datasets. Discipline is "handlers only mutate; never
read another handler's intermediate state."
